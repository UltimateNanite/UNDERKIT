# UNDERKIT

## A C++/SFML-based Undertale engine.

**UNDERKIT** is a work-in-progress game engine for **UNDERTALE** fangames.


## Features
(Essentially a to-do list at this stage)

- Intricately recreated battle engine
- Accurate overworld gameplay with built-in level editor, powered by [Dear ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- No more 30fps lock!

## Installation

Visual Studio 2019 is recommended (.sln files included). I *assume* the setup for other IDEs is fairly straightforward, but I honestly have no idea.


## Dependencies

- [SFML 2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
- [Dear ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and its [SFML binding](https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml)
- [ChaiScript](http://chaiscript.com/) (note: unused at time of writing, may be removed in future releases)
